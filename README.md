# OnSave

## What is this?
This is a small utility to define tasks to perform when files are modified
without needing to use a specific text editor.

I wrote this while building my resum√©, as I'm currently transitioning
between text editors and wanted an editor-agnostic approach to
defining these tasks that I have full control over.
